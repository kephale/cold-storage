description: AreTomo2 is a multi-GPU accelerated software package that automates motion-corrected
  marker-free tomographic alignment and reconstruction. It includes robust GPU-accelerated
  CTF estimation, offering fast, accurate, and easy integration into subtomogram processing
  workflows. AreTomo2 is capable of on-the-fly reconstruction of tomograms and CTF
  estimation in parallel with tilt series collection, enabling real-time sample quality
  assessment and collection parameter adjustments.
